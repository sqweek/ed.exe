Implement commands:

e
f
G
j
k
l
t
u
W
x
y
z

Bugs:

r doesn't support reading command output via !
w doesn't support quitting (wq)
s/// doesn't support \1 \2 etc. in replacement
deleting whole buffer with g/./d leaves ed in broken state
g/foo/s/bar/qux  reports an error for every line that doesn't match /bar/
